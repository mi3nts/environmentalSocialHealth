    "The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is a coding system used to classify and code various diseases, conditions, and medical procedures. It is primarily used for billing and statistical purposes in the healthcare industry. ICD-10-CM is organized into chapters, and these chapters are further divided into various categories. The major categories of ICD-10-CM include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Infectious and Parasitic Diseases (A00-B99)**: This category covers diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, including conditions like tuberculosis, HIV, and various infectious diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neoplasms (C00-D49)**: Neoplasms are abnormal growths or tumors, including both benign and malignant (cancerous) tumors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diseases of the Blood and Blood-Forming Organs and Certain Disorders Involving the Immune Mechanism (D50-D89)**: This category includes disorders of the blood, bone marrow, and the immune system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Endocrine, Nutritional, and Metabolic Diseases (E00-E89)**: Covers diseases related to the endocrine system (e.g., diabetes), nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (F01-F99)**: Encompasses mental health disorders and conditions related to behavior and neurodevelopment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Diseases of the Nervous System (G00-G99)**: Includes neurological conditions and diseases affecting the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Diseases of the Eye and Adnexa (H00-H59)**: Covers eye-related conditions and disorders of the adnexa (e.g., eyelids).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Diseases of the Ear and Mastoid Process (H60-H95)**: Addresses conditions related to the ear and mastoid process.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Diseases of the Circulatory System (I00-I99)**: Encompasses cardiovascular diseases, including heart conditions, hypertension, and vascular disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Diseases of the Respiratory System (J00-J99)**: Includes disorders of the respiratory tract, such as pneumonia, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Diseases of the Digestive System (K00-K95)**: Covers gastrointestinal disorders, including conditions related to the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Diseases of the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue (L00-L99)**: Addresses skin conditions and disorders of the subcutaneous tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue (M00-M99)**: Includes disorders of the musculoskeletal system, bones, muscles, and connective tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Diseases of the Genitourinary System (N00-N99)**: Covers conditions related to the urinary system and male/female reproductive organs.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Puerperium (O00-O9A)**: Encompasses conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period (P00-P96)**: Addresses conditions that affect newborns and infants.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **Congenital Malformations, Deformations, and Chromosomal Abnormalities (Q00-Q99)**: Covers congenital anomalies and chromosomal disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **Symptoms, Signs, and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not Elsewhere Classified (R00-R99)**: This category includes codes for symptoms, signs, and abnormal test results when a definitive diagnosis hasn't been made.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Injury, Poisoning, and Certain Other Consequences of External Causes (S00-T88)**: Encompasses codes for various injuries, poisonings, and other consequences of external causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **External Causes of Morbidity (V00-Y99)**: Addresses the external causes of injuries, including accidents, intentional self-harm, and other factors contributing to health problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services (Z00-Z99)**: This category includes codes for encounters with the healthcare system, as well as factors influencing health status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these major categories is further subdivided into more specific codes that provide detailed information about diseases, conditions, and medical procedures, allowing for precise diagnosis and billing in the healthcare industry."
